The deck is shuffled. One card is handed to each player in order. 
A second card is handed to each player order. Then comes the more complicated part of the deal. 
 First, the top card of the deck is discarded. This is called the burn. 
Three cards are then placed in the centre of the table, which is called the flop. 
Another card is burned, meaning we discard another card from the top of the deck. 
We add another card to the centre, which is called the turn. We burn another card.
 Finally, there's the river, where a fifth and final card is added to the centre.
